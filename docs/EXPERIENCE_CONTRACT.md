# Experience contract

What every screen in this application promises, stated once so that a screen
cannot promise something else. The contract covers the four things a user meets
on every page: the action bar and what each action requires, the states a
region can be in (empty, loading, failed), the strings and their translations,
and the permission metadata each action declares.

```
python3 -m core.experience.docgen docs/EXPERIENCE_CONTRACT.md
```

The block below is generated from the contracts, the source strings and the
catalogs themselves. Nothing in it is typed by hand and nothing in the
hand-written half carries a count: a number in two places is a number that will
disagree with itself.

### Translation coverage, measured

Counted from the catalogs the build ships - the Babel catalogs under `translations/` and the JavaScript UI packs under `static/js/i18n/locales` - against the strings in the message template. `translated` excludes strings that are identical to the source, which are counted as `fallback`.

| Language | Catalog entries | Source strings | Translated | Fallback | Missing | Coverage | Of which translated |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ar` | 4460 | 3713 | 3619 | 18 | 76 | 98.0% | 97.5% |
| `fa` | 4236 | 3713 | 3357 | 19 | 337 | 90.9% | 90.4% |
| `he` | 4236 | 3713 | 3355 | 21 | 337 | 90.9% | 90.4% |
| `hr` | 4021 | 3713 | 3605 | 26 | 82 | 97.8% | 97.1% |

### Coverage per screen

The strings a screen's contract asks for, and how many of them a language actually translates. Looked up by semantic key first and by the English source string second, because the catalogs still key by source string today; `by key` is the part of the migration that has happened.

### Screens nobody has described yet

These have a contract derived from the registry, so they work: they have an identity, a navigation entry, a lifecycle and a help topic. What they do not have is a description of what they offer - columns, filters, actions, states - because nobody has decided it. The list is the remaining work, not a defect.

`dashboard`, `search`, `categories`, `email_words`, `lexis_cosmos`, `analyst_categorization`, `notifications`, `signal_horizon`, `monitoring`, `input_ingestion`, `import_center`, `archives`, `path_analysis`, `map_viewer`, `batch_analysis`, `classification`, `comprehensive_dashboard`, `reports`, `reports_dashboard`, `retention`, `schedules`, `charts_dashboard`, `detection`, `jobs`, `import_export_console`, `users`, `audit_log`, `settings`, `translation_manager`

### Contract validation

Every contract passes the declarative checks: no SQL, no imports, no calls, no authorisation decisions, destructive actions carry a confirmation, bulk actions require a selection, and no key holds two different source strings.

_Generated from 35 contracts, 3713 source strings and 5 catalogs._

## The four promises

| promise | what it means | where it is checked |
|---|---|---|
| a failure is announced, a wait is polite | `role="alert"` for what went wrong, `role="status"` for what is in progress | the component library |
| an action states what it needs | a confirmation, a selection, a reason - declared, not improvised | this contract |
| permission metadata is declared, not assumed | an action with no declared permission is reported, not allowed | the screen inspector |
| a string has one home | a source string and its translations come from the catalogs, never from a literal in a template | the generated block above |
