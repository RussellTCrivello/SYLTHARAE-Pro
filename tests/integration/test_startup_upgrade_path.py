"""Regression tests for the startup schema-upgrade path.

Deployment defect found during PR #11 acceptance: migrations ran only via
the first-install setup wizard, so an EXISTING installation that pulled
new code containing a new migration started against a stale schema
(``relation "analyst_categories" does not exist``). ``initialize_system``
now applies pending migrations on every (non-first) startup.
