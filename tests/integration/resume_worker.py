"""Subprocess worker for the crash-recovery tests.

Runs one ingestion pass over a folder against a real PostgreSQL database and
can terminate itself at a chosen storage boundary:

* ``KILL_BEFORE_STORE=k``: exit before the k-th store call starts (nothing of
  store k is written).
* ``KILL_AFTER_STORE=k``: exit after the k-th store call has returned, which is
  after its database commit and before the checkpoint mark for that file.

``os._exit`` skips every cleanup handler, so the process dies the way a power
loss or a killed service does.  Prints ``STORE_CALLS=<n>`` on normal exit.

Usage: resume_worker.py <folder> <checkpoint_file>
Environment: DB_HOST, DB_PORT, DB_NAME, DB_USER (read by the application).
