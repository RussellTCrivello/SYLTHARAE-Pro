"""A failed administrator step must not leave the system "initialized".

Found by the round-10 clean-install drill. ``install.py --non-interactive`` on
an install directory whose ``.env`` no longer carried ``APP_ADMIN_PASSWORD``:

    ✓ Database & schema   Created 'syltharae_clean'; 3 migration(s) applied
    ✗ Administrator       Password must be at least 12 characters
    ✓ Runtime directories  7 directories ensured
    ✓ Finalize            System marked as initialized

Steps D and E ran anyway, so ``.system_initialized`` was written with
``SELECT count(*) FROM users`` = 0. The result is a system nobody can log in
to: /auth/login has no account, and /setup refuses because the marker says the
installation is done. The administrator step is the one step whose failure
leaves the system unusable, so it has to stop the sequence.
