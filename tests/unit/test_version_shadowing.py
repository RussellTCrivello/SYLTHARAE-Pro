"""Unit: the application version cannot be shadowed by another ``version`` module.

``apps/web/app.py`` and four other modules did ``from version import
get_version``. That resolves through ``sys.path``, and a third-party package can
put its own directory there: OpenCV's loader inserts ``<site-packages>/cv2`` while
it imports, and when the import *fails* (it needs ``libGL.so.1``, which a
headless deployment does not have) the insertion is never undone. The next
``from version import get_version`` then imports ``cv2/version.py``, which has no
``get_version``, and every page that renders the release line answers 500.

That is not hypothetical: it is what made two seeded module orders fail 222 ids
in this round - a module that touched an image ran before a module that rendered
a page. The fix is to stop resolving the application's own version through
``sys.path`` at all; these tests fail if anyone puts the name back.
