"""One pagination model for every server-paged table.

The model (the same for every list page, the Show More batch included)::

    size     the Per Page value. It is the only row limit. A Show More batch is
             exactly one page of this size, so the two can never disagree.
    page     the page the view is on. A full page request shows that page; a
             Show More request appends the next one. The pager points at the
             last page loaded.
    total    the rows the current filters and sort produce. total_pages is
             derived from it: max(1, ceil(total / size)).

Rules that follow from the model:

* A page navigation, a size change, or a filter/sort change replaces the view
  with one page (filters and sort reset to page 1).
* A full-page request for a page past the end is clamped to the last page. The
  filters may have shrunk the list since the link was made; the page shown is
  then the one the pager says it is.
* A Show More batch past the end returns NO rows. Clamping a batch would
  append the last page a second time, which is a duplicate. An empty batch is
  how the table learns there is nothing more to load.

Routes call :func:`fetch_page` with a function that returns ``(rows, total)``
for one page; nothing else decides page numbers, sizes or boundaries.
