# Event types emitted to job_events / SSE (spec section 10).
#
# This is the vocabulary `job_events.event_type` actually receives, so it must
# list every string the job system can write:
#   * the phase/file/data events below, emitted by the starters and the
#     throttle list in `services/jobs/manager.py`;
#   * the lifecycle events (`JOB_*`), emitted by the manager;
#   * `PROGRESS` - the throttle-related heartbeat, emitted per
#     `JOBS_PROGRESS_INTERVAL`;
#   * `JOB_PAUSED`;
#   * the terminal event, which carries the job **status** rather than a
#     separate name (see `Manager._finish` -> `_publish(job_id, status)`), so
#     `FAILED` is part of this vocabulary too.
# `tests/unit/test_job_event_vocabulary.py` derives the emitted set from those
# call sites and fails if a new string is published without being listed here;
# before that test existed this tuple was missing PROGRESS, JOB_PAUSED and
# FAILED - three values the manager writes - so it could not have been used to
# validate the column.
