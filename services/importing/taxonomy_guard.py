"""The guard rails an automatic apply needs before it deletes anything.

The workbook is authoritative, which is a good rule and a dangerous one: a
truncated download, a half-saved file and a workbook whose sheets were emptied
are all "authoritative" too, and a startup apply has nobody to ask. This module
is the answer to "how much of the taxonomy may one sync remove without a human?"

It measures *removals* - unlinked terms, deleted keywords, categories the
workbook no longer mentions and categories a plan would delete - against what the
database currently holds, and refuses above a fraction. The fraction is
``SYLTHARAE_TAXONOMY_SHRINK_MAX`` (0..1, default 0.25): a sync that would remove
more than a quarter of what is stored is refused with the numbers in the message,
and the operator raises the limit deliberately if that is what they meant.

Refusing is the right failure for a boot-time step. A confirmation prompt cannot
be answered at 3am by a supervisor, and "applied, look at the log" is how a
taxonomy disappears.
