"""Category hierarchy: every read and write against ``categorys.parent_id``.

No new tables. The tree is derived with recursive CTEs over the two columns the
frozen schema already has (``categorys.parent_id`` from ``m0002``, and the name
in ``words.word``), and the cycle rule is enforced in two places: by the
database trigger (``m0004``) and, with a readable message, here.

The one query
=============

``fetch_tree`` answers with one prepared statement. For every node it returns
``depth``, the materialised ``sort_key`` (zero-padded id path) and ``id_path``,
``child_count`` (direct children), ``own_terms`` (words assigned to the node),
``descendant_count`` and ``total_terms`` (own plus every descendant's own). The
subtree totals come from an ancestor/descendant closure - one row per
(node, ancestor) pair - so the cost is ``sum(subtree size)``, not a per-node
walk, and a 100 000-node tree is measured in
``tests/integration/test_category_hierarchy_scale.py``.

Pagination is keyset on ``sort_key``: stable under concurrent inserts (a new
node sorts next to its parent, it does not shift a page), and it never asks
PostgreSQL to walk and discard ``OFFSET`` rows.

Names are unique per sibling, case-insensitively. Note what the schema does on
its own: a category name *is* a ``words`` row (``categorys.word_id``), and
``words.word`` is UNIQUE across the table, so two categories can never share a
name even in different subtrees. ``sibling_name_taken`` and
``name_in_use`` therefore report two different things - the first is the rule
this module enforces, the second is the consequence of the schema, and both are
refusals rather than silent renames.

# The whole-tree query above is linear in the size of the tree and is built for
# the CSV export and for search. Painting a page does not need it: the browser
# only has to draw the roots, then the children of whatever is expanded. These
# helpers answer exactly that and nothing else, so the cost of the first paint
# is the cost of one level, not of the catalogue.
#
# Each row carries the two counts that are cheap for a node - how many children
# it has and how many words are assigned to it directly - and nothing that needs
# a subtree walk. ``descendant_count`` and ``total_terms`` are deliberately
# absent: computing them for the root of a hundred-thousand-node tree costs the
# whole tree, which is the thing being avoided. ``node_stats`` answers those for
# one node when the operator asks for them.

#: Above this many nodes the whole-tree endpoint says so in its payload; the
#: page shows the warning instead of pretending the export is free.
